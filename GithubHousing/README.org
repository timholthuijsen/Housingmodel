* Introduction
This repository contains the start of your first machine learning assignment. It
covers a few different skills:

- How to work with git
- How to import code from various files in Python
- How to train and improve a simple machine learning model

* Preparation
- Make sure to have git installed
- Clone this repository from its [[https://git.auc-computing.nl/david/housing-model][source]] to your local machine.

* Assignment
The purpose of this assignment is to experiment with, and make improvements to
the basic model provided. We use the Mean Squared Error (MSE) to evaluate how
big of an improvement has been made to the model. Similarly, we will use git to
track changes made to the code, and share progress with each other.

** Requirements
As a minimum, you are expected to implement the following:
- At least 1 method to scale or normalise the data & target variable
- Use different columns in the data to predict median house value
- Try different models, and compare their performance with linear regression
- Try different values for hyper parameters (if your model has any) to see if
  they influence the MSE.
- Find and make use of a method to add the non-numeric features as input to your
  model
- Combine all your changes, experiments, and improvements into your 'final'
  model, and reduce MSE by as much as possible.

Besides this, we recommend experimenting with Git (making and merging branches),
and to make good use of the documentation for scikit-learn to come up with some
new ideas for the house value model!

Each individual step above must be committed to git before Thursday September
24th.
